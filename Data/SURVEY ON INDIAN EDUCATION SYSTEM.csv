Students and teachers need to detach themselves from scoring marks and learn and try things for what they are,how interesting they are, how relevant they are, the research scope, industry scope, sub topics, detailed explanations etc. This is what mattera to the student in the long run i.e retention of knowledge.

Subjects should be taught by including more practical scenarios. Students should be taught to not memorise theory and run after marks but rather understand and grow their knowledge to later apply in real life scenarios. A more wider range of subject selection should be made available to the students so that they can mix and match subjects that they like. ,Gamification gives a sense of achievement and makes learning fun
